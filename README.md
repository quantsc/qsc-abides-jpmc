<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

ABIDES (Agent Based Interactive Discrete Event Simulator) is a general purpose multi-agent discrete event simulator. Agents exclusively communicate through an advanced messaging system that supports latency models.

The project is currently broken down into 3 parts: ABIDES-Core, ABIDES-Markets and ABIDES-Gym.

* ABIDES-Core: Core general purpose simulator that be used as a base to build simulations of various systems.
* ABIDES-Markets: Extension of ABIDES-Core to financial markets. Contains implementation of an exchange mimicking NASDAQ, stylised trading agents and configurations.
* ABIDES-Gym: Extra layer to wrap the simulator into an OpenAI Gym environment for reinforcement learning use. 2 ready to use trading environments available. Possibility to build other financial markets environments easily.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Installation

1. Download the ABIDES source code, either directly from GitHub or with git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/abides-jpmc-public
    ```

    **Note:** The latest stable version is contained within the `main` branch.

2. Run the install script to install the ABIDES packages and their dependencies:

    ```
    sh install.sh
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage (regular)
Regular ABIDES simulations can be run either directly in python or through the command line

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

### Using a Python Script:

```python
from abides_markets.configs import rmsc04
from abides_core import abides

config_state = rmsc04.build_config(seed = 0, end_time = '10:00:00')
end_state = abides.run(config_state)
```
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Using the abides Command:

The config can be loaded and the simulation run using the `abides`
command in the terminal (from directory root):

```
$ abides abides-markets/abides_markets/configs/rmsc04.py --end_time "10:00:00"
```

The first argument is a path to a valid ABIDES configuration file.

Any further arguments are optional and can be used to overwrite any parameters
in the config file.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Usage (Gym)
ABIDES can also be run through a Gym interface using ABIDES-Gym environments.

```python
import gym
import abides_gym

env = gym.make(
    "markets-daily_investor-v0",
    background_config="rmsc04",
)

env.seed(0)
initial_state = env.reset()
for i in range(5):
    state, reward, done, info = env.step(0)
```

## Default Available Markets Configurations

ABIDES currently has the following available background Market Simulation Configuration:

* RMSC03: 1 Exchange Agent, 1 POV Market Maker Agent, 100 Value Agents, 25 Momentum Agents, 5000 Noise Agents
 
* RMSC04: 1 Exchange Agent, 2 Market Maker Agents, 102 Value Agents, 12 Momentum Agents, 1000  Noise Agents
